## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Implement a Design from Scratch" project, masterfully guided by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer, and Guillaume Salva, CTO at Holberton School. This project, with a weight of 3, is a challenge to implement a web page from scratch without relying on any library. The task is to utilize your knowledge of HTML, CSS, Accessibility, and Responsive design acquired in previous modules. Your goal is simple: create a fully functional web page that mirrors the designer's file.

## Project Details

You wonâ€™t have a lot of specific instructions; you are free to implement the web page in the way that you find suitable. The objective is clear: create a fully functional web page that matches the designer's vision.

The final result should look like this :
